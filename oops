# class Car:
#     def _init_(self,company,model,evOrNot,noOfTyres):
#         self.company = company
#         self.model = model
#         self.evOrNot = evOrNot
#         self.noOfTyres = noOfTyres

# # Creating a Object

# Car1 = Car("TOYOTA","ETIOS","EV",4)
# # print(Car1.company)

# # print(f"{Car1.company} launched it's New Model Called {Car1.model} it is {Car1.evOrNot} and have {Car1.noOfTyres} tyres ")

# car2 = Car("MAHINDRA","THAR",'FUEL',4)
