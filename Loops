# Loops : they are the Block of Codes to perform any task repeatedly

# Loops can be Applied on :
#   1. List , Tuple, set, dictionary, Strings
# 

# Iteration : No of Times the Loop should run

# for : for loop runs as long as the condition is True

# For Loop Applied on List : 
# 

# fruits = ['apple','banana','mango','Grapes','Orange']

# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)

# for i in range(0,11):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(1,10): 
#     print(i)

# myPlace = 'Mysore'

# for letter in myPlace:
#     print(letter)


# break and COntinue Statements: 
# break : it stops Iterating when the Particular Condition

# fruits = ['apple','banana','mango','Grapes','Orange']

# for fruit in fruits:

#     if(fruit =='mango'):
#         continue

#     print(fruit)



# While : loop runs as long as the COndition becomes false.

# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#   print(i)
#   i += 1

# i=0
# while i<11:
#     print(i)
#     i+=1

# i = 0
# while i < 6:
#   i += 1
#   if i == 3:
#     continue # to skip the current Iteration
#   print(i)
